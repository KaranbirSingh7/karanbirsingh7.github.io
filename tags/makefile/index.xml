      <description>I have been using Makefile from spinning up docker containers to setting up local dev environment venv (yeah I know I should be using docker-compose) and I can safely say its still one of the best tools out for automating tasks.
Recently I included Makefile into this repo so that I can build/publish/run hugo site easily without having to look through documentation on which command to run for local-server or build assets.</description>
