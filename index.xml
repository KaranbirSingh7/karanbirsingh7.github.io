      <description>I have been using Makefile from spinning up docker containers to setting up local dev environment venv (yeah I know I should be using docker-compose) and I can safely say its still one of the best tools out for automating tasks.
Recently I included Makefile into this repo so that I can build/publish/run hugo site easily without having to look through documentation on which command to run for local-server or build assets.</description>

      <description>I have been using openssl command line for past few weeks to rotate some of the yearly expiring certs on our internal platforms. If you are one of my co-worked reading this, then you know what I am talking about üòÅ.
So I thought this can make a good blog post as well as it can also serve as a cheatsheet/reference for future myself.
This list of most common OpenSSL commands from SSLShopper covers more of the what I have below.</description>

      <description>This weekend I spent my time configuring dotfiles and automating the development setup on mac using ansible playbooks.
Inspired by geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook
Why would you need something like this for development setup?
Normally, you never know when your machine (mac) is going to have issues and you need to reconfigure new machine with all the required tools and configurations. In corporate world, it is normal to have your machine replaced for certain reasons.</description>
