They mention that if the SRE is having trouble keeping up, they pull product developers into the on-call rotation as a feedback mechanism, but feedback is not as strong as if product developer was usually on-call.</li>\n<li>Liked the \"100% is the wrong reliability target\" section. Keeps things in perspective that 100% and 99.999% are pretty indistinguishable to users.</li>\n<li>Error budget is a neat idea w.r.t. \"spending\" the error budget. If you already attempted a risky rollout that didn't go well last week, maybe wait til next month to launch the next risky feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2---the-production-environment-at-google\"><a href=\"#chapter-2---the-production-environment-at-google\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 2 - The Production environment at Google</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Borg (by extension K8S) and BOSH performs similar jobs, although Borg has a stronger focus on bin-packing and scheduling batch jobs, like a mash-up between Diego and BOSH.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe something like Chris and Jim's Crucible gets us closer to resource limits</li>\n<li>BOSH needs better support for A/B testing</li>\n<li>Service discovery was a BOSH shortcoming for a long time as it favored static IPs.

If your reliability is too high, are you not taking enough risks or added too much redundant machines?</li>\n<li>Tracking reliability improvements or regressions over time seems super key. Do we know if our project has become more of less reliable in the last 6 months?</li>\n<li>I really like the request success rate as a better metric than uptime. Uptime treats an outage during peak hours the same as an outage when few people are using it. Also a flaky service could still technically say they are still have solid uptime.</li>\n<li>I like that the authors try to keep things in perspective. Going from 99.9% to 99.99% may actually lose you money if the added engineering cost outweighs the added revenue. And if ISPs' error rate is 1% to 0.1%, can the user even tell the difference between 99.9% and 99.99%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4---service-level-objectives\"><a href=\"#chapter-4---service-level-objectives\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 4 - Service Level Objectives</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\"The Global Chubby Planned Outage\" is a neat strategy for finding components that are misusing the service. The SREs will intentionally take down the Chubby lock service if it is over its availability SLO in order to quickly identify components that have an unreasonable expectation of reliability.</li>\n<li>Collecting client-side metrics, e.g. how long before the page rendered, seem useful but more difficult to track.</li>\n<li>\"Choose just enough SLOs to provide good coverage of your system’s attributes\"</li>\n<li>\"It’s better to start with a loose target that you tighten than to choose an overly strict target that has to be relaxed when you discover it’s unattainable.\"</li>\n<li>SLO as a prioritization mechanism feels like a nice way to track goals via objective numbers, e.g. is this implementation getting us closer or farther from our goal</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5---eliminating-toil\"><a href=\"#chapter-5---eliminating-toil\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 5 - Eliminating Toil</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I like the differentiation between overhead and toil, especially the \"no enduring value\" part:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhead: \"Overhead is often work not directly tied to running a production service, and includes tasks like team meetings, setting and grading goals, snippets, and HR paperwork.\"</li>\n<li>Toil: \"Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\"If you’re too willing to take on toil, your Dev counterparts will have incentives to load you down with even more toil\"</li>\n<li>Should we start doing this to help our managers? - \"Googlers record short free-form summaries, or \"snippets,\" of what we’ve worked on each week.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6---monitoring-distributed-systems\"><a href=\"#chapter-6---monitoring-distributed-systems\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 6 - Monitoring Distributed Systems</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I like the distinction between black-box and white-box monitoring</p>\n<ul>\n<li>White-box: exposing internal system metrics emitted by components, might help predict problems / trends</li>\n<li>Black-box: externally visible behavior as seen by the end-user, indicates that something is wrong right now</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For \"Why Monitor?\", we definitely have Alerting, Dashboards, and Debugging, but Long-term trends and Experiments over time could help us be pro-active.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four Golden Signals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latency: Time it takes to serve a request</li>\n<li>Traffic: How much demand is on your system, e.g. requests per second</li>\n<li>Errors: Rate of failed requests</li>\n<li>Saturation: How much extra capacity does your system have?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>+1 to keeping your monitoring as simple as possible to avoid a brittle maintenance mess</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review metrics every so often to see if not useful ones can be removed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Checklist for designing an alert seems useful, I especially like \"Pages should be about a novel problem or an event that hasn’t been seen before.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7---the-evolution-of-automation-at-google\"><a href=\"#chapter-7---the-evolution-of-automation-at-google\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 7 - The Evolution of Automation at Google</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we have to staff humans to do the work, we are feeding the machines with the blood, sweat, and tears of human beings.
